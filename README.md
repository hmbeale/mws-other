# MWS Restaurant Project Submission
This is my submission for the third stage of the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree.


## Getting Started
Clone this repository and run it with a simple local server. Then clone the stage 3 development server described below. Run both simultaneously to correctly view the site.


### Installing
Clone these repositories to separate locations.
```
git clone https://github.com/hmbeale/mws-restaurant-stage-1
```
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3
```


## Deployment
Use this bit of python with the stage three folder to get it going.
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
Use node to run the sails server in your stage three folder.
```
node server
```
With both node and python up, view the site in your browser. localhost:8000 should show the site if you've used the commands above.
